////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Add a new Pokemon to the Pokedex.
// Note: just adding the Pokemon to the Pokedex does not mean it has
// been 'found'.
//
// The new Pokemon should be added to the end of the Pokedex (i.e.
// directly after the Pokemon that was added when add_pokemon was last
// called).
//
// When the first Pokemon is added to the Pok√©dex, the currently
// selected Pokemon becomes this Pokemon.
//
// The currently selected Pokemon remains the first Pokemon that was
// inserted into the Pokedex, until the `change_current_pokemon`,
// `next_pokemon`, or `prev_pokemon` functions are called.
//
// If there is already a Pokemon in the Pokedex with the same pokemon_id
// as this Pokemon, the function should print an appropriate error
// message and exit the program.
//
// Pokedex Order:
// --------------
// The Pokemon in the Pokedex are stored in the order in which they were
// added, i.e. the first Pokemon in the Pokedex will be the first
// Pokemon that was added, the second Pokemon in the Pokedex will be the
// second Pokemon that was added etc, and the last Pokemon in the
// Pokedex will be the Pokemon that was added most recently.
//
// For example, if Pikachu (#025) was added into an empty Pokedex, the
// Pokedex would now contain Pikachu at the start of the list, and
// Pikachu would be the currently selected Pokemon.
//
// [Start of Pokedex]
// #025: Pikachu <-- currently selected Pokemon
// [End of Pokedex]
//
// If Squirtle (#007) was then added, it would be the second Pokemon in
// the Pokedex, after Pikachu. The currently selected Pokemon would
// remain Pikachu.
//
// [Start of Pokedex]
// #025: Pikachu <-- currently selected Pokemon
// #003: Squirtle
// [End of Pokedex]
//
// If Diglett (#050) was then added, it would be the third Pokemon in the
// Pokedex, after Squirtle.
//
// [Start of Pokedex]
// #025: Pikachu <-- currently selected Pokemon
// #003: Squirtle
// #050: Diglett
// [End of Pokedex]

//
// If the Pokemon has not been found, the output should be:
//   Id: 007
//   Name: ********
//   Height: --
//   Weight: --

//   Weight: 90.5kg
//   Type: Fire Flying

// you will implement in Stage 2 (e.g. `next_pokemon`).
//
// See the `test_next_pokemon` function in test_pokedex.c for a concrete
// example of this function being used.
//
// If the Pokedex is empty, this function should print an appropriate
// error message and exit the program.

// Print out all of the Pokemon in the Pokedex, in the order in which

//     #007: ********
//     #010: Caterpie
//     #013: Weedle
//     #016: Pidgey
//
// An arrow should be displayed next to the currently selected Pokemon.
//
// If a pokemon_id has less than three digits, it should be printed with
// leading '0's.
//
// If it has more than three digits, it should be printed as-is.
//
// --> #001: Bulbasaur
//     #004: **********
//     #007: ********
//     #010: Caterpie
//     #013: Weedle
//     #1263: Jabberwocky

// This function emulates what happens when a player goes out exploring
// and comes across different Pokemon.
//
// When exploring, it is possible for the player to encounter any of the
// Pokemon that are stored in Pokedex, whether or not that Pokemon has
// been 'found' yet.
//
// To determine which Pokemon the user should encounter, this function
// should generate a random number between 0 and `factor - 1`
// (inclusive), which represents a pokemon_id.
//
// If there is a Pokemon with that pokemon_id in the Pokedex, the player
// has now 'found' that Pokemon.
//
// If there is no Pokemon with that pokemon_id in the Pokedex, nothing
// is done with that pokemon_id.
//
// This process should be repeated until `how_many` Pokemon have been
// encountered.
//
// If it is not possible to encounter any Pokemon with the given
// parameters (e.g. there are no Pokemon in the Pokedex with pokemon_id
// between 0 and `factor - 1`), this function should print an
// appropriate error message and exit the program.
//

// evolve into the Pokemon with the ID `to_id`.
//
// See the evolution chart at https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/squirtle for

//
// For this assignment you can assume that every Pokemon can only evolve

//
// For example, if the function was called three times:

// evolve_pokemon(pokedex, 0, 1)
// evolve_pokemon(pokedex, 0, 2)
// evolve_pokemon(pokedex, 0, 3)
//
// The end result of the these three function calls would be that
// Pokemon 0 evolves into Pokemon 3 (rather than 1 or 2).
